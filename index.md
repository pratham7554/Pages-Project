# Name: **Pratham Mittal**

Major: Math-CS

> I finished high school in India and am currently a junior. I like to watch sports especially cricket and basketball, and I also enjoy making use of the many online technical tools. I'm fairly new to git and am enjoying it.

An example of a git command I learnt is:
`git add`

*I prefer to keep my day organized using a reminder list as follows:*

- Grocery Shopping
- CSE 110 lecture
- Homework


Another option could be prioritizing the important work like:

1. CSE 110 lecture
2. Homework
3. Grocery Shopping

To stay updates we could use Task Lists as:

- [ ] Grocery Shopping
- [x] CSE 110 lecture
- [ ] Homework
